# Joe's dotfiles.

Like @paul_irish says, [mathias's readme](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) is where to start. I'm like four places removed and I'm sure some unwise decisions have been made along the way. The biggest changes I've made have been to get rid of Vim related stuff (blech) and use zsh instead of bash.

I also customize my prompt in a way that's based heavily on [this Nettuts+ article](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/how-to-customize-your-command-prompt/)

The rest of this I'm shamelessly copying from Paul's readme. Why, you say? The doctor says I'm lazy.



## install the neccessary apps

My basic setup is captured in `install-deps.sh` which adds homebrew, z, nave, etc.

## private config

Toss it into a file called `.extra` which you do not commit to this repo and just keep in your `~/`

I do something nice with my `PATH` there:

```shell
# PATH like a bawss
      PATH=/opt/local/bin
PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/sbin
PATH=$PATH:/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/.rvm/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/code/git-friendly
# ...

export PATH
```

## Syntax highlighting

â€¦is really important. even for these files.

Install [Dotfiles Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/mattbanks/dotfiles-syntax-highlighting-st2) via [Sublime Text 2 Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)


### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

## Similar projects

I recommend getting a [`.jshintrc`](https://github.com/jshint/node-jshint/blob/master/.jshintrc) and [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/) defined for all your projects.
